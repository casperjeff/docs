# Streamline by iStream Financial

Streamline is an ultra-modern payments API designed to make integrations with ISVs, gateways, and other partners as easy as possible—while providing world-class features and deep visibility across the entire payments lifecycle.

## Why Streamline

- **powerful rails** — ach (same-day, next-day), rtp, and flexible rail selection strategies
- **end-to-end observability** — clear states, webhooks, idempotency, and auditability
- **smart operations** — automatic rail selection, smart retries, and instant availability evaluation
- **enterprise-grade** — oauth2, scoped api keys, encryption at rest, pci-aware practices

## What you can build

- payouts and collections at scale
- recurring billing with clear reconciliation and settlement reporting
- pass-through or aggregated gateway flows

## A tiny taste

Authenticate with client credentials and make your first request. Replace placeholders to match your environment.

```bash
# 1) get an access token
curl -s -X POST "$API_BASE/oauth2/token" \
  -u "$CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
  -d "scope=payments:write payments:read" \
  | jq .

# 2) create a payment (example shape)
curl -s -X POST "$API_BASE/payments" \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "idempotency-key: $UNIQUE_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "amount": "125.00",
    "currency": "USD",
    "payment_method": "auto",
    "source_account_id": "acct_src_123",
    "destination_account_id": "acct_dest_456",
    "metadata": { "order_id": "ORD-10001" }
  }' | jq .
